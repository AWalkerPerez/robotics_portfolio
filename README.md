# 🤖 Andrea's Robotics and Control Systems Portfolio

Welcome to my comprehensive portfolio showcasing expertise in autonomous systems, motion planning, Sim2Real reinforcement learning, and high-precision embedded control.

The projects within this repository highlight a strong foundation in theoretical concepts (Kinematics, PID/DLS Control, ROS2) and practical implementation (Custom Hardware, PCB Design, Sim2Real Transfer).

## 📁 Accessing Project Code and Documentation

While this portfolio provides a high-level overview of the implementation and results, the complete source code, detailed design files (CAD, PCBs), and extended documentation for each project are hosted in separate, dedicated repositories.

Please refer to my GitHub profile for links to the full project repositories: [https://github.com/AWalkerPerez](https://github.com/AWalkerPerez)
